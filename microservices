REST API
========
-->Web Service:Software System designed for machine-to-machine interaction over a network
3 Key factors
=============
1)Machine-to-Machine or Application-to Application interaction
2)Platform Independent
3)Allow communication over network

To make platform independent
============================
Communication(Request & Response) between webservice and consumers should happen in platform independent formats (XML or JSON)


Webservice(Service Provider) --------Request/Response(XML or JSON) --------Service Consumer

2 Webservice Categories
=======================
SOAP WS --SOAP XML as request/response format
Rest WS--Build on top of HTTP protocol using its methods (GET/POST/DELETE)
